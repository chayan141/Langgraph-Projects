Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning model that consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is tasked with creating new data samples, such as images, while the discriminator's role is to differentiate between real data samples and those generated by the generator.

There are several types of GANs, including:
1. Vanilla GANs: The basic form of GAN that uses a generator and discriminator network.
2. Conditional GANs (cGANs): These GANs take additional input, such as class labels, to generate more specific output.
3. Wasserstein GANs (WGANs): A type of GAN that uses the Wasserstein distance to measure the difference between real and generated data.
4. Progressive GANs: These GANs gradually grow the resolution of generated images over time.
5. CycleGANs: GANs used for image-to-image translation tasks, such as style transfer or colorization.
